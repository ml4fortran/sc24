## Abstract

Fortran has been used extensively in HPC for computationally intensive
applications in various fields of science and engineering.
Recent advances in machine learning (ML), and especially the deep learning
methods, bring new opportunities to accelerate, make more accurate, and
otherwise improve computationally intensive Fortran applications.
However, lack of mature Fortran frameworks for deep learning, as well as the
lack of robust compiler support for GPU-based acceleration has led to the
development of diverse and _ad hoc_ approaches to ML in Fortran applications.
These approaches have ranged from pure-Fortran deep learning frameworks, and
specialized but limited custom inference code, to interfacing mature Python
frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow via Fortran interfaces to C.
This workshop aims to bring together the community of developers and
practitioners of ML for Fortran to exchange ideas and foster new collaborations
in this emerging field.
The scope includes Fortran frameworks for machine learning, Fortran interfaces
to ML frameworks in other languages, and the use of ML in Fortran applications.
